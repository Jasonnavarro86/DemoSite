          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct. (2 Timothy 3:15-17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21)</p>

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The one true God has revealed Himself as the eternally self-existent &quot;I AM,&quot; the Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed Himself as embodying the principles of relationship and association as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10,11; Matthew 28:19; Luke 3:22)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">Jesus Christ</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">We believe in the Deity of Christ as the second person in the Trinity. As God&#x27;s Son Jesus was both human and divine. We affirm His virgin birth, sinless life, &amp; the miracles he performed. We believe in His substitutionary work on the cross, His bodily resurrection from the dead, and His exaltation to the right hand of God. (Matthew 1:23; Hebrews 7:26; Acts 2:22; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Hebrews 1:3)</p>

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">Man was created good and upright; for God said, &quot;Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness.&quot; However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from God.

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">Man&#x27;s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God, according to the hope of eternal life. (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13-15; Ephesians 2:8)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">Ordinances of the Church</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">1. BAPTISM IN WATER - The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded by the Scriptures. All who repent and believe on Christ as Saviour and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with Him to walk in newness of life. (Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4)<br><br>2. HOLY COMMUNION - The Lord&#x27;s Supper, consisting of the elements --bread and the fruit of the vine-- is the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ, a memorial of his suffering and death, and a prophecy of His second coming, and is enjoined on all believers &quot;till He come!&quot; (2 Peter 1:4; 1 Corinthians 11:26; 1 Corinthians 11:26)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">The Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The baptism in the Holy Spirit is a special experience following salvation that empowers believers for witnessing and effective service, just as it did in New Testament times. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry. (Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:1-31)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">Initial Physical Evidence</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance. (Acts 2:4)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">Sanctification<br></h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">Sanctification initially occurs at salvation and is not only a declaration that a believer is holy, but also a progressive lifelong process of separating from evil as believers continually draw closer to God and become more Christlike. (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12)</p>

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The Church has a mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin. We believe &#x27;the Church&#x27; is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who, throughout time, have accepted God&#x27;s offer of redemption through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 1:22,23; Matthew 28:19,20; Ephesians 4:11-16)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">The Ministry</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in evangelization of the world, worship of God, building a body of saints being perfected in the image of His Son, and meeting the human need with ministries of love and compassion. (Mark 16:15-20; John 4:23,24; Ephesians 4:11-16; Galatians 2:10; 6:10)</p>

          <h2 class="h2 text-span">Divine Healing</h2>
          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the atonement, and is the privilege of all believers. (Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:16,17; James 5:14-16)</p>

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the church. (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52)</p>

          <p class="paragraph cc-gray">There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to the everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
